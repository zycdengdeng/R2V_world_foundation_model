NVIDIA Cosmos™ is a platform purpose-built for physical AI, featuring state-of-the-art generative world foundation models (WFMs), robust guardrails, and an accelerated data processing and curation pipeline. Designed specifically for real-world systems, Cosmos enables developers to rapidly advance physical AI applications such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), robots, and video analytics AI agents.

Cosmos World Foundation Models come in three model types which can all be customized in post-training: [cosmos-predict](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5), [cosmos-transfer](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5), and [cosmos-reason](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1).

* [October 6, 2025] We released [Cosmos-Transfer2.5](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5) and [Cosmos-Predict2.5](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5) - the next generation of our world simulation models!
* [June 12, 2025] As part of the Cosmos family, we released [Cosmos-Transfer1-DiffusionRenderer](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/cosmos-transfer1-diffusion-renderer)

## Cosmos-Transfer2.5

Cosmos-Transfer2.5 is a multi-controlnet designed to accept structured input of multiple video modalities including RGB, depth, segmentation and more. Users can configure generation using JSON-based controlnet_specs, and run inference with just a few commands. It supports both single-video inference, automatic control map generation, and multiple GPU setups.

Physical AI trains upon data generated in two important data augmentation workflows.
